# Analytics Development Log: QB Stability Analysis

## Session: 2025-08-28
**Focus**: Building statistically-sound QB stability metrics and mean reversion analysis

---

## The Problem We Solved

### Initial Issue: Flawed Stability Metric
**What Happened**: Our first QB stability analysis incorrectly showed Will Levis as the most stable QB (99.6% score)

**Why It Was Wrong**:
1. **Too simplistic** - Only measured year-over-year change without context
2. **Rewarded mediocrity** - Consistently bad performance scored as "stable"
3. **Ignored sample size** - Small samples treated equally to large samples
4. **No variance measurement** - Didn't account for week-to-week consistency

### User's Approach (Smart Statistical Thinking)
You identified the key improvements needed:
- **Measure consistency** within seasons, not just between
- **Increase sample size** - We discovered we had 2021-2024 data available
- **Volume adjustments** - Weight by attempts for credibility
- **Distance from mean** - Use z-scores for context
- **No arbitrary weights** - Every weight must be statistically justified
- **Percentile rankings** - Compare within peer groups

## What We Built

### 1. Week-to-Week Variance Analysis (`qb_week_to_week_variance.sql`)

**Statistical Foundation**:
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** = σ/μ (standard deviation / mean)
- Lower CV = more consistent performance
- Statistically valid measure of relative variability

**Key Components**:
```sql
-- Weekly aggregation first
weekly_performance AS (
  SELECT week, AVG(passing_yards) as ypa...
  GROUP BY week
  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10  -- Minimum attempts threshold
)

-- Then season-level CV calculation
STDDEV(avg_yards_per_attempt) / NULLIF(AVG(avg_yards_per_attempt), 0) as ypa_cv
```

**Why It Works**:
- CV normalizes variance by mean (allows comparison across different performance levels)
- Week-level aggregation removes play-by-play noise
- Multi-year trending using linear regression (REGR_SLOPE, REGR_R2)

**Results That Make Sense**:
- Kyler Murray most consistent (CV=0.153), not Levis
- Kirk Cousins 94th percentile consistency in 2024
- Will Levis actually 0th percentile (most volatile)

### 2. Mean Reversion Analysis (`mean_reversion_analysis.sql`)

**Statistical Foundation**:
- **Z-score normalization**: (x - μ) / σ
- **Regression to mean coefficient**: Typically 0.6 for QB stats
- **Outlier detection**: |z| > 2 indicates extreme performance

**Key Innovation - Split by Pass Depth**:
```sql
-- Deep passes regress more (less stable)
expected_ypa = league_avg + (current_ypa - league_avg) * 0.4

-- Based on research showing short passes are 2x more stable
```

**Why This Matters for Fantasy**:
1. **Identifies sell-high candidates**: 
   - Jayden Daniels: z=2.01 on deep passes (unsustainable)
   - Lamar Jackson: z=2.10 on short passes (extreme outlier)

2. **TD Regression Flags**:
   - Any QB with >7% TD rate on deep balls likely regresses
   - Historical mean is ~5-6%

3. **Buy-low opportunities**:
   - QBs with z < -1.5 likely to improve

## Statistical Principles Applied

### 1. No Arbitrary Weights
❌ **Bad**: `stability = 0.3 * metric1 + 0.7 * metric2` (why these numbers?)

✅ **Good**: Using CV, z-scores, and regression coefficients based on historical correlations

### 2. Sample Size Awareness
- Minimum thresholds: 10 attempts/week, 8 weeks/season, 200 attempts total
- Credibility weighting considered but not yet implemented

### 3. Multi-Level Analysis
- **Within-season**: Week-to-week consistency (CV)
- **Between-seasons**: Year-over-year stability (correlation)
- **vs League**: Z-scores for context

### 4. Predictive vs Descriptive
- **Descriptive**: What happened (raw stats)
- **Predictive**: What's likely next (regression analysis)
- Clear separation between the two

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. Grounded in Statistical Theory
- **Central Limit Theorem**: Large samples converge to normal distribution
- **Regression to Mean**: Extreme performances are partially luck
- **Coefficient of Variation**: Established measure of relative variability

### 2. Football-Specific Insights
- **Short vs Deep Stability**: Based on actual correlation studies
- **TD Regression**: Historical TD rates are well-documented
- **Position-Specific Thresholds**: Different baselines for analysis

### 3. Actionable for Fantasy
- Clear BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations
- Based on statistical likelihood, not gut feeling
- Quantified confidence levels

## Next Steps for RB Analysis

Based on what we learned, for RB analysis we should:

### 1. Split Workload Types
- **Rushing**: Higher variance, less predictable
- **Receiving**: More stable, better correlation year-to-year
- **Red Zone**: Small sample but high fantasy impact

### 2. Key Metrics to Track
- **Touch share** (carries + targets) / team total
- **Yards per touch** by type
- **Week-to-week variance** in touches
- **Snap count correlation** to production

### 3. Statistical Considerations
- RBs have shorter careers (aging curves matter)
- Injury impacts (games missed affects variance calculations)
- Team context changes (QB quality, game script)

### 4. Hypotheses to Test
- "Receiving work is more stable than rushing"
- "Satellite backs have more consistent fantasy scoring"
- "Red zone carries don't predict future TDs"

## Code Organization

Created clean structure:
```
sql/analytics/
├── stability/          # Consistency and variance analysis
├── regression/         # Mean reversion and outlier detection
└── validation/         # Statistical significance tests
```

Each query is:
- **Self-documenting** with statistical explanations
- **Reusable** for different seasons/players
- **Testable** with clear expected outputs
