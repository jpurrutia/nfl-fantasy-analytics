# NFL Analytics MVP - Project Plan & Progress

## Project Overview
Building a fantasy football analytics platform that evolves from CLI MVP to full web application, focusing on data-driven insights for lineup optimization and player analysis.

## Development Philosophy
- **KISS, DRY, SOLID, YAGNI** - Keep it simple, avoid over-engineering
- **Incremental Development** - Build step-by-step with review points
- **Developer Review** - Each phase requires your feedback before proceeding
- **Data-Driven** - Analytics based on your fantasy football expertise

## Current Status: Phase 0 Complete âœ…

---

## Phase 0: Foundation Setup âœ… COMPLETE
**Goal**: Establish project structure and core infrastructure

### âœ… Completed Tasks:
1. **Project Structure** - Organized directories (`src/`, `data/`, `sql/`, `tests/`, `config/`)
2. **Python Environment** - Python 3.11 + uv package manager
3. **Dependencies** - Resolved `nfl-data-py` compatibility with pandas < 2.0
4. **Configuration** - YAML config, environment variables, `.gitignore`
5. **Database Setup** - DuckDB with bronze/silver/gold medallion architecture
6. **ESPN Integration** - Refactored connector tested with your league

### âœ… Review Point Results:
- Database successfully created with all schemas
- ESPN connector verified with "Weenieless Wanderers" league
- All dependencies installed and compatible
- Ready for Phase 1 development

## Phase 1: Core Data Pipeline ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Establish data ingestion pipeline with review at each step

### Phase 1 Tasks:
1. **NFL Data Integration** - Connect `nfl-data-py` for historical data
2. **Data Ingestion Scripts** - Load raw data to bronze tables
3. **Player Mapping System** - Bridge ESPN and NFL data sources
4. **Data Quality Checks** - Validation and error handling
5. **Bronze Layer Population** - Historical player/performance data

### Phase 1 Decision Points:
- [ ] **Data Quality Location**: Python (flexible) or SQL (performant)?
- [ ] **Historical Data Scope**: How many seasons to load initially?
- [ ] **Update Frequency**: Daily, weekly, or on-demand?

### Phase 1 Review Points:
- [ ] Test NFL data ingestion with sample data
- [ ] Verify player mapping accuracy
- [ ] Validate data quality and completeness

## Phase 2: Analytics Engine ðŸ”œ PENDING
**Goal**: Build analytics incrementally with extensive feedback

### Phase 2 Tasks:
1. **Stability Metrics** - Correlation scores, variance calculations (YOUR FEEDBACK REQUIRED)
2. **Efficiency Metrics** - RYOE/CPOE models (YOUR FEEDBACK REQUIRED)  
3. **Simple Projections** - Weighted averages, floor/ceiling (YOUR FEEDBACK REQUIRED)
4. **Silver Layer Transformations** - Clean and standardize data
5. **Analytics Views** - Create reusable query patterns

### Phase 2 Decision Points:
- [ ] **Analytics Engine**: Python (complex models) or SQL (simpler, faster)?
- [ ] **Calculation Parameters**: Stability windows, weighting factors
- [ ] **Model Complexity**: Start simple or build advanced features?

### Phase 2 Review Points:
- [ ] Validate stability calculations against your intuition
- [ ] Review efficiency model outputs
- [ ] Test projections accuracy

---

## Phase 3: Application Logic ðŸ”œ PENDING
**Goal**: Create CLI tools for practical use

### Phase 3 Tasks:
1. **Lineup Optimization** - Algorithm using projections + roster requirements
2. **CLI Interface** - Commands for `lineup`, `projections`, `insights`
3. **Weekly Insights** - Buy/sell/hold recommendations
4. **Gold Layer Analytics** - Application-ready aggregated data
5. **Interactive Prompts** - User-friendly CLI experience

### Phase 3 Decision Points:
- [ ] **Orchestration**: Prefect (lightweight) or Airflow (robust)?
- [ ] **CLI Framework**: Click (current) or Rich for enhanced UI?
- [ ] **Output Formats**: Table, JSON, CSV priorities?

### Phase 3 Review Points:
- [ ] Test lineup recommendations with your league settings
- [ ] Validate insights against your fantasy knowledge
- [ ] UX feedback on CLI commands

---

## Phase 4: Enhancement & Polish ðŸ”œ PENDING
**Goal**: Refine based on usage

### Phase 4 Tasks:
1. **Performance Optimization** - Query tuning, caching, indexes
2. **Testing Suite** - Unit tests, integration tests, fixtures
3. **Error Handling** - Robust error recovery and logging
4. **Documentation** - API docs, user guides, data dictionary
5. **Data Quality Monitoring** - Automated validation and alerts

---

## SQL Learning Integration ðŸ“š

### LeetCode-Style Challenges Created:
- **Challenge 1**: Top RB performers (Easy)
- **Challenge 2**: Target share analysis (Medium)  
- **Challenge 3**: Consistency metrics (Medium)
- **Challenge 4**: Red zone efficiency (Hard)
- **Challenge 5**: Matchup analysis (Hard)

**Location**: `sql/practice/sql_challenges.md`
