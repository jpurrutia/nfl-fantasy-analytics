# NFL Analytics Project Log

## Purpose
Track all development sessions, progress, and changes with timestamps for better project management and understanding of work evolution.

## Session: 2025-08-28
**Status**: In Progress  
**Focus**: QB Stability Analysis and Mean Reversion

### Completed
- Fixed flawed QB stability metric that incorrectly ranked Will Levis as most stable
- Implemented statistically-sound Coefficient of Variation (CV) for consistency measurement
- Added multi-year analysis using 2021-2024 data (discovered we had 4 years available)
- Created z-score based mean reversion analysis for regression candidates
- Built percentile rankings for peer comparison
- Identified Jayden Daniels and Lamar Jackson as "sell high" candidates
- Documented statistical methods in analytics development log

### Key Technical Decisions
- **No arbitrary weights** - All metrics based on statistical theory (CV, z-scores, regression coefficients)
- **Week-to-week variance** - More predictive than year-over-year changes alone
- **Split by pass depth** - Short passes 2x more stable than deep (research-backed)
- **Regression coefficient** - Using 0.6 for QB stats based on historical correlations

### Key Findings
1. **Most Consistent QBs**: Kyler Murray (CV=0.153), Kirk Cousins (CV=0.160), Mahomes (CV=0.166)
2. **Regression Candidates**: QBs with z-scores > 2 (Daniels deep, Lamar short)
3. **TD Regression**: Any QB with >7% deep TD rate likely regresses to 5-6%

### Files Created
- `sql/analytics/stability/qb_week_to_week_variance.sql`
- `sql/analytics/regression/mean_reversion_analysis.sql`
- `sql/analytics/README.md`
- `docs/analytics_development_log.md`

### Next: RB Analysis
User will do manual EDA, then we'll build:
- Rush vs receiving stability comparison
- Touch share consistency metrics
- Red zone correlation analysis

## Session: 2025-08-23
**Status**: Complete  
**Focus**: Setting up project logging and session tracking

### Tasks
- [x] Create slash commands for Claude Code workflows
- [x] Create session-start.md and session-end.md commands  
- [x] Create draft-prep.md with ADP download notes
- [x] Create draft commands: analyze-player, data-quality-check, fix-failing-tests, update-schema
- [x] Implement atomic session logger (src/utils/session_logger.py)
- [x] Document coding conventions and patterns

### Notes
- Established explore-plan-code-commit workflow pattern
- Created .claude/commands/ directory for slash commands
- Implemented atomic, stateless session logging to avoid state corruption
- Deferred analyze-player, data-quality-check, fix-failing-tests, update-schema as .draft.md files for future work
- Session logger uses atomic writes - no state tracking, fully deterministic

### Key Decisions
- Chose atomic logging over stateful session tracking for simplicity
- Draft commands saved as .draft.md files (not ready for use)
- Focus on essential commands first, defer complex analytics
